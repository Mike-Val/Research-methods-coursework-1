Cloning by either deliberately or by coincidence. Cloning has pros and cons in software development. Bug propagation may be caused by cloning from original to copied segments. Cloning may lead to difficulties in software maintenance. Cloning is helpful in many functions like code reusability, inheritance, and libraries. Software developers before scripting the code design the model for it. Cloning can exist at any stage either at the design or coding phase, which influences on development, quality, and maintenance of the software. All software has constraints like budget and time are associated. In software development, life cycle budget and time constraints depend on irregularity and risk. These irregularities and risks can be minimized by identifying clones. There are different kinds of clones in Code and Model. In this paper, we present a concise summary of design and coding phase clone detection of these irregularities and risk as well as their for's and against of code clone detection and model clone detection.","","978-1-6654-1703-7","10.1109/ICRITO51393.2021.9596454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9596454","Software clone;Code clone;model clone;Code Clone detection;Model clone detection","Computer languages;Software maintenance;Codes;Redundancy;Cloning;Software systems;Software","C language;software maintenance;software reusability","model clone detection;code clone detection;code fragments;software development;software maintenance;code design;coding phase clone detection;code reusability;software quality","","","","21","IEEE","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Excessive code clones in software system will cause a negative impact on system development and maintenance. In recent years, as deep learning has become a hot research area of machine learning, researchers have tried to apply deep learning techniques to code clone detection tasks. They have proposed a series of detection techniques using including unstructured (code in the form of sequential tokens) and structured (code in the form of abstract syntax trees and control-flow graphs) information to detect semantically similar but syntactically different code clone, which is the most difficult-to-detect clone type. However, although these methods have achieved an important improvement in the precision of semantic code clone detection, the corresponding false positive rate(FPR) is also at a very high level, making these methods unable to be effectively applied to real-world code bases. This paper proposed SCCD-GAN, an enhanced semantic code clone detection model which based on a graph representation form of programs and uses Graph Attention Network to measure the similarity of code pairs and achieved a lower detection FPR than existing methods. We built the graph representation of the code by expanding the control flow and data flow information to the original abstract syntax tree, and equipped with an attention mechanism to our model that focuses on the most important code parts and features which contribute much to the final detection precision.We implemented and evaluated our proposed method based on the benchmark dataset in the field of code clone detection-BigCloneBench2 and Google Code Jam. SCCD-GAN performed better than the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and false positive rate.","","978-1-7281-9422-6","10.1109/ICECE54449.2021.9674552","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9674552","Semantic Code Clone Detection;Graph Attention Network;Abstract Syntax Tree;Deep Learning","Deep learning;Codes;Semantics;Cloning;Syntactics;Maintenance engineering;Software systems","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;program diagnostics;software maintenance;trees (mathematics)","SCCD-GAN;enhanced semantic code clone detection model;semantically similar but syntactically similar code fragments;different code fragments;code base;excessive code clones;deep learning techniques;code clone detection tasks;detection techniques;control-flow graphs;semantically similar but syntactically different code clone;clone type;real-world code bases;code pairs;lower detection FPR;important code parts;final detection precision;code clone detection-BigCloneBench2;Google Code Jam","","","","20","IEEE","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, this limits their ability to detect semantic clones. To address this issue, we propose a code clone detection method based on event embedding tree and Graph Attention Network. Our method uses a program control flow graph to capture the execution characteristics of each statement and extract the context relationship of different statements in the control flow. Based on such information, our method can calculate the functional similarity of two pieces of code, thereby identifying semantically similar code fragments.

In this paper, we propose a fast code clone detection method based on weighted recursive autoencoders (RAE) to measure code similarity at the function level. Different from manually defining features for code clone detection, our deep learning-based method can automatically learn program features. First, we analyze program abstract syntax trees using weighted RAE, extract the program features and encode the functions to vectors. During the modeling process, we consider node weight information in abstract syntax trees to increase the proportion of information contributed by important nodes in the final vector representation of one program. Second, we report functions with similar vectors as code clone pairs. The second phase is time consuming when analyzing large software systems because it needs quadratic pairwise comparisons. To solve this problem, we transform the clone detection problem into an approximate nearest neighbors search (ANNS) in a high-dimensional vector set and use the navigating spreading-out graph to reduce the computational time complexity. Experimental results on BigCloneBench show that our method outperforms the compared algorithm based on unweighted RAE in terms of precision, recall, and AUC value and can return clone pairs in approximately 33 min, while the compared algorithm requires approximately 14 days when performing pairwise comparisons among 785,438 functions' vectors. Our method also outperforms many prominent tools, including Oreo, in detecting Moderately Type-3 or Type-4 clones, and our false positive rate (FPR) equals 0.055, which means few false positives. More importantly, our method has no need for labeled data, and all of the source code is released to guarantee experimental reproducibility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2938825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8822436","Code clone;fast code clone detection;abstract syntax tree;weighted recursive autoencoders;navigating spreading-out graph","Cloning;Feature extraction;Computer bugs;Syntactics;Measurement;Deep learning;Navigation","computational complexity;computational linguistics;feature extraction;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;program diagnostics;software metrics;software quality;source code (software);trees (mathematics);vectors","BigCloneBench;computational time complexity;navigating spreading-out graph;ANNS;program features extraction;vector representation;high-dimensional vector set;approximate nearest neighbors search;node weight information;weighted RAE;program abstract syntax trees;deep learning-based method;code similarity;fast code clone detection method;software quality problems;recurring bugs;software development;weighted recursive autoencoders;source code;unweighted RAE","","11","","35","CCBY","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is the most common way of reusing source code in software development. If a bug is identified in one segment of code, all the similar segments need to be checked for the same bug. Consequently, this cloning process may lead to bug propagation that significantly affects the maintenance cost. By considering this problem, code clone detection (CCD) appears as an active area of research. Consequently, there is a strong need to investigate the latest techniques, trends, and tools in the domain of CCD. Therefore, in this paper, we comprehensively inspect the latest tools and techniques utilized for the detection of code clones. Particularly, a systematic literature review (SLR) is performed to select and investigate 54 studies pertaining to CCD. Consequently, six categories are defined to incorporate the selected studies as per relevance, i.e., textual approaches (12), lexical approaches (8), tree-based approaches (3), metric-based approaches (7), semantic approaches (7), and hybrid approaches (17). We identified and analyzed 26 CCD tools, i.e., 13 existing and 13 proposed/developed. Moreover, 62 open-source subject systems whose source code is utilized for the CCD are presented. It is concluded that there exist several studies to detect type1, type2, type3, and type4 clones individually. However, there is a need to develop novel approaches with complete tool support in order to detect all four types of clones collectively. Furthermore, it is also required to introduce more approaches to simplify the development of a program dependency graph (PDG) while dealing with the detection of the type4 clones.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2918202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8719895","CCD;SLR;code clone detection;CCD tools;code clone types","Cloning;Charge coupled devices;Tools;Semantics;Software;Computer bugs;Databases","program debugging;public domain software;software metrics;software reusability;source code (software);trees (mathematics)","code clone detection;systematic literature review;PDG;program dependency graph;metric-based approaches;lexical approaches;SLR;software development;source code reusing;CCD tools;open-source subject systems;bug propagation;semantic approaches;tree-based approaches","","27","","77","OAPA","22 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering this, a new lightweight Interface Driven Code Clone Detection (IDCCD) technique is proposed, that can detect clones by using method interface similarities. First, the method blocks are tokenized from the source files. For those method block tokens, interface information is extracted and indexed with mapped tokens. Then, similar interfaces are queried from that index and compared those with a similarity function for detecting clones.

Many classic approaches rely on handcrafted aggregation schemes, while recent work uses supervised or unsupervised learning. In this work, we study several aspects of aggregation schemes for code clone detection based on supervised learning. To this aim, we implement an AST-based Recursive Neural Network. Firstly, our ablation study shows the influence of model choices and hyperparameters. We introduce error scaling as a way to effectively and efficiently address the class imbalance problem arising in code clone detection. Secondly, we study the influence of pretrained embeddings representing nodes in ASTs. We show that simply averaging all node vectors of a given AST yields strong baseline aggregation scheme. Further, learned AST aggregation schemes greatly benefit from pretrained node embeddings. Finally, we show the importance of carefully separating training and test data by clone clusters, to reliably measure generalization of models learned with supervision.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-0591-8","10.1109/SANER.2019.8668039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668039","Code Clone Detection;Abstract Syntax Trees;Embeddings;Recursive Neural Network;Siamese Network","Cloning;Training;Recurrent neural networks;Biological neural networks;Logic gates;Syntactics","neural nets;software maintenance;supervised learning","code clone detection;handcrafted aggregation schemes;supervised learning;learned AST;AST-based recursive neural network;learning-based recursive aggregation;abstract syntax trees;software projects;error scaling;class imbalance problem","","28","","40","","18 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the prevailing of smart and IoT (Internet of Things) devices, more and more programs are ported from traditional desktop platform (e.g., IA-32) to ARM and MIPS architectures. It is imperative to detect cloned binary code across architectures. However, because of incomparable instruction sets of different architectures as well as alternative compiling configurations of binaries, it is difficult to conduct a binary code clone detection with traditional syntax-or structure-based methods. To address, we propose a semantics-based approach to fulfill the target. We recognize arguments and indirect jump targets of each binary function, and emulate executions of those functions to extract semantic signatures helping measure the similarity of functions. The approach has been implemented in a prototype system names CACompare to detect cloned binary functions across architectures and compiling configurations. It supports comparisons between mainstream architectures (IA-32, ARM and MIPS) and is able to analysis binaries on Linux platform. The experimental results show that CACompare not only is effective in dealing with binaries of different architectures and variant compiling configurations, but also improves the accuracy of binary code clone detection comparing to state-of-the-art solutions.","","978-1-5386-0535-6","10.1109/ICPC.2017.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7961507","binary program analysis;code clone detection;reverse engineering;static analysis","Registers;Computer architecture;Binary codes;Cloning;Switches;Semantics;Instruction sets","binary codes;Linux;program compilers;software architecture","binary code clone detection;architectures;similarity detection;plagiarism detection;malware analysis;software vulnerability assessment;program comprehension;smart devices;IoT devices;Internet of Things;desktop platform;IA-32;ARM architectures;MIPS architectures;structure-based methods;syntax-based methods;semantics-based approach;indirect jump targets;semantic signatures;prototype system;CACOMPARE;mainstream architectures;Linux platform;variant compiling configurations;instruction sets","","30","","34","","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a solution, this paper presents an experimental testbed, which consists of a collection of “clone detection components (CDCs)”. CDCs are concrete representations of tasks associated with clone detection experiments such as data extraction, pre-processing and detection of clones.

To carry out research on code review, sufficient review data is normally required. As a result, recent efforts commonly focus on analysis for projects with sufficient reviews (called “s-projects”), rather than projects with extremely few ones (called “f-projects”). Actually, through statistics on public platforms, the latter ones dominate open source software, in which novel approaches should be explored to improve their review-based code improvement. In this paper, we try to address the problem via building a review sharing channel where the informative review can be reasonably delivered from s-projects to the f-projects. To ensure the accuracy of shared reviews, we introduce a novel code clone detection model based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and build suitable “s-projects, f-projects” pairs through the clone detection. Especially, to alleviate the dataset heterogeneity between the training and testing, an autoencoder-based semi-supervised learning strategy is employed. Furthermore, to improve the sharing experience, heuristic filtering tactics are applied to reduce the time cost. Meanwhile, the LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)-based ranking algorithm is used for presenting diverse review themes. We have implemented the sharing channel as a prototype system RSharer+, which contains three representative modules: data preprocessing, code clone detection and review presentation. The collected datasets are first transformed into context-sensitive numerical vectors in the data proprecessing. Then in the clone detection, data vectors are trained and tested on the BigCloneBench and real code-review pairs. At last, the presentation module provides review classification and theme extraction for better sharing experience. Extensive comparative experiments on hundreds of real labelled code fragments demonstrate the precision of clone detection and the effectiveness of review sharing.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966532","Science and Technology Planning Project of Tianjin, China(grant numbers:17JCZDJC30700,17YFZCGX00610,18ZXZNGX00310); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City(grant numbers:19JCQNJC00300); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:63191402); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8959206","Code clone;software review;deep learning;semi-supervised CNN;review sharing","Cloning;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Syntactics;Computer bugs;Software;Testing","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);public domain software;software maintenance;software quality","RSharer+;sharing channel;latent Dirichlet allocation-based ranking algorithm;heuristic filtering tactics;f-projects;s-projects;CNN;convolutional neural network;user feedback;labelled code fragments;review classification;real code-review pairs;diverse review themes;LDA-based ranking algorithm;sharing experience;autoencoder-based semisupervised learning strategy;novel code clone detection model;shared reviews;informative review;review sharing channel;review-based code improvement;sufficient review data;code quality;code review;deep semisupervised code clone detection","","2","","73","CCBY","14 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The F1 score of our technique on detecting Java clones with pervasive code modifications is comparable to five well-known code clone detectors: CCFinderX, Deckard, iClones, NiCad, and Simian. A Gaussian blur filter is chosen as a normalisation technique for type-2 and type-3 clones. We found that blurring code images before similarity computation resulted in higher precision and recall.

This phenomenon is common when programmers copy a code segment along with adding or removing several statements, or use a more flexible syntax structure to implement the same function. In this paper, we unify the aforementioned problems as the problem of code misalignment, and propose a novel code alignment network to tackle it.

However, evaluating precision is still challenging, because of the intensive and specialized manual effort required to accomplish the task. Moreover, when precision is reported, it is typically done over all types of clones, making it hard to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the corresponding clone detectors. This paper presents systematic experiments to evaluate precision of eight code clone detection tools. Three judges independently reviewed 12,800 clone pairs to compute the undifferentiated and type-based precision of these tools. Besides providing a useful baseline for future research in code clone detection, another contribution of our work is to unveil important considerations to take into account when doing precision measurements and reporting the results.

We also compare a large number of algorithms for code clone detection. Comparing the performance of a large number of machine learning techniques, ANN and non-ANN, using such features, and establishing that fusing of AST and PDG features gives competitive results using deep learning as well as boosted tree algorithms, we find that boosted tree algorithms like XGBoost are quite competitive in clone detection.

This problem has been exacerbated by the wealth of open-source software projects, as code is often copy-pasted to new locations. This causes a serious problem when a new security vulnerability is discovered in a particular software project, as it may potentially affect many others. Discovering vulnerable code reuse in source code is known as vulnerable code clone detection. This is a very challenging problem as the cloned code has the potential to be modified, sometimes significantly, from the original code, while still retaining the underlying vulnerability. Existing vulnerable clone detection techniques are either too strict, missing vulnerabilities when they have subtle modifications, or are too narrow, applicable only to a small number of vulnerability types. In this work we present VGRAPH, a technique for identifying vulnerable code clones, which is more robust to code modification, while still remaining generic to all vulnerability types. VGRAPHs are representations of vulnerable source code comprising three graph-based components representing code property relationships extracted from the contextual code, the vulnerable code, and the patched code. We develop a matching algorithm utilizing these three graph-based components which is able to identify vulnerable code clones with a precision of 98% and recall of 97%. Even for highly modified code clones, we are able to identify over 100 more vulnerable clones than the best performing comparison work ReDeBug. When we apply our technique to several versions of popular software packages (e.g., FFMpeg, OpenSSL), we are able to identify 10 vulnerabilities which were silently patched and are not listed in the National Vulnerability Database.","","978-1-7281-5087-1","10.1109/EuroSP48549.2020.00012","DARPA(grant numbers:N66001-18-C-4033); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1350766,1618706,1717774); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9230372","vulnerability;code clone;source code;static analysis;software security","Codes;Databases;Software packages;Cloning;Approximation algorithms;Distance measurement;Security","graph theory;program diagnostics;public domain software;security of data;software maintenance","VGRAPH;robust vulnerable code clone detection system;software vulnerabilities;open-source software projects;security vulnerability;vulnerable code reuse;vulnerable clone detection techniques;vulnerability types;code modification;vulnerable source code comprising;code property relationships;contextual code;patched code;highly modified code clones;National Vulnerability Database","","6","","29","","2 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some of code clones are considered as a factor of bug replications and make it more difficult to maintain software. Various code clone detection tools have been proposed so far. However, in most algorithms adopted by existing clone detection tools, if program statements are reordered, they are not detected as code clones. In this research, we examined how clone detection results change by rearranging the order of program statements. We performed preprocessing to rearranging the order of program statements using program dependency graph (PDG). We compared clone detection results with and without preprocessing. As a result, by rearranging the order of program statements, the number of detected code clones is almost the same in most projects. We classified newly detected or disappeared clones manually. From our experimental results, we show that there is no newly detected clone whose statements are reordered and that there are four disappeared clones whose statements are reordered. We think three out of the four clones occurred by copy-and-paste operations. Therefore, we conclude that rearranging the order of program statements is not effective to detect reordered code clones.","","978-1-5090-6595-0","10.1109/IWSC.2017.7880503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880503","","Cloning;Software algorithms;Software;Terminology;Computer bugs;Java;Information science","graph theory;program debugging;software tools;source code (software)","program statement order rearrangement;code fragment;source code;bug replications;code clone detection tools;program dependency graph;PDG;copy-and-paste operations","","4","","14","","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article proposes functional code clone detector using attention (FCCA), a deep-learning-based code clone detection approach on top of a hybrid code representation by preserving multiple code features, including unstructured (code in the form of sequential tokens) and structured (code in the form of abstract syntax trees and control-flow graphs) information. Multiple code features are fused into a hybrid representation, which is equipped with an attention mechanism that pays attention to important code parts and features that contribute to the final detection accuracy.

Therefore, we speeded the detection process of NiCad, and and named the improved tool NiCad+. We greatly improved the efficiency of NiCad without effecting its recall and precision. The time-cost of detecting code clone was remarkable shortened by reducing the matching times. When testing with BigCloneEval, it only takes 28.43% time-cost as original NiCad.

The detection of code clones helps to improve the quality of source code through software re-engineering. Numerous methods have been proposed for code clone detection in Java code. However, the existing methods are mostly based on the Java source code, while only a few focus on its bytecode, in fact, the Java bytecode reflects more of the semantic nature of the source code than the source code itself does. In this paper, we propose a novel code clone detection method based on Java bytecode. Using the block-level code fragments extracted from bytecode, it can simultaneously detect code clones at both method level and block level. In addition, during the process of code clone detection, the similarities of both method call sequences and instruction sequences are calculated in order to improve accuracy. We conduct two extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our method.

One of the reasons behind this is the reliance of these advanced techniques on lexing and parsing programs. Modern programming languages have complex lexical conventions and grammar, which evolve constantly. Therefore, using advanced code-clone detection techniques requires substantial and continuous effort. This paper proposes a lightweight language-independent method to detect code clones by simply finding repeated strings in a code repository, relying on neither lexing nor parsing. The proposed method is based on an efficient technique developed in a bio-informatics context to find repeated strings. We refer to the repeated strings in the source-code as weak Type-1 clones. Because the proposed technique normalizes newlines, tabs, and white spaces into a single white space, it can find clones in which newline positions or indentations are changed, as often in the case when copy-pasting occurs. Although the proposed method only finds verbatim copies, it also makes interesting observations regarding repository structures. Many developers may prefer the proposed simple approach because it is easier to understand than other advanced techniques that use heuristics, approximation, and machine learning.","2640-0715","978-1-6654-3784-4","10.1109/APSEC53868.2021.00057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712025","","Industries;Computer languages;Codes;Cloning;Machine learning;White spaces;Grammar","grammars;learning (artificial intelligence);program compilers;program diagnostics;programming languages;software maintenance","source-code;Type-1 clones;repeated strings;code repository;advanced code-clone detection techniques;lexing parsing programs;code clones","","","","17","IEEE","17 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although many approaches were proposed to automatically detect code clones, the results are not satisfactory. A major reason is that it is difficult to extract syntax and semantic information from the source code. To resolve this problem, in this article, we develop a novel graph representation approach based on intermediate code to detect the functional code clones. This graph representation is built based on intermediate code compiled from the source code. By using it, we can easily utilize graph embedding techniques to extract syntactic and semantic features from abstract syntax tree, control flow graph, and DFG generated from intermediate code. After that, we use the Softmax classifier to detect functional code clone pairs. We evaluate the performance of the proposed graph representation approach based on intermediate code for the code clone detection task on the BigCloneBench dataset. In order to improve performance, the embedded representation of intermediate code is initialized based on pretrained vectors learned from the collected LLVM IR dataset in advance. The experimental results show that our proposed intermediate code-based graph approach performs better than existing functional code clone detection approaches. Especially for the type-4 code clone detection, our approach outperforms the baseline approaches by an average of 33.49% in the term of <italic>F</italic>1 score.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2022.3176922","Science and Technology Development Fund of Macau(grant numbers:0047/2020/A1); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M621247); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:LH2019F008); Hong Kong RGC Project(grant numbers:PolyU15222320); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9792461","Abstract syntax tree (AST);clone code detection;control flow graph (CFG);data flow graph (DFG);graph embedding;intermediate code","Codes;Cloning;Syntactics;Semantics;Data mining;Task analysis;Feature extraction","","","","","","","IEEE","9 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

These tools target clone detection in software applications written in a single programming language. However, a software application may be written in different languages for different platforms to improve the application's platform compatibility and adoption by users of different platforms. Cross language clones (CLCs) introduce additional challenges when maintaining multi-platform applications and would likely go undetected using existing tools. In this paper, we propose CLCDSA, a cross language clone detector which can detect CLCs without extensive processing of the source code and without the need to generate an intermediate representation. The proposed CLCDSA model analyzes different syntactic features of source code across different programming languages to detect CLCs. To support large scale clone detection, the CLCDSA model uses an action filter based on cross language API call similarity to discard non-potential clones. The design methodology of CLCDSA is two-fold: (a) it detects CLCs on the fly by comparing the similarity of features, and (b) it uses a deep neural network based feature vector learning model to learn the features and detect CLCs. Early evaluation of the model observed an average precision, recall and F-measure score of 0.55, 0.86, and 0.64 respectively for the first phase and 0.61, 0.93, and 0.71 respectively for the second phase which indicates that CLCDSA outperforms all available models in detecting cross language clones.","2643-1572","978-1-7281-2508-4","10.1109/ASE.2019.00099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8952189","Code Clone;API documentation;Word2Vector;Source Code Syntax","Cloning;Feature extraction;Java;Software systems;Syntactics","application program interfaces;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;program diagnostics;programming languages;software maintenance;source code (software)","software application;programming language;cross language API call similarity;deep neural network based feature vector;cross language code clone detection;syntactical features;software clones;software maintenance;CLCDSA model;API documentation;deep neural network;feature vector learning model;source code analysis","","14","","63","","9 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, code clones detection may be introduced as the foundation of Software Evolution, in this way most topics in Software Evolution depends on the detection of code clones. In addition to other methods, two methods have been introduced yet, behavioral method (slower but more accurate) and memory state based method (faster with medium accuracy). In this research, the goal is to find more clones with a better accuracy than the Abstract Memory State (AMS) based method (Reduction of False Negative). To do this, the combinations of two methods of AMS and Program Dependency Graph (PDG) have been used. The method of executing code snippets is also used with random values. The method presented in this study is compared with the AMS based method and results show that it can detect more code clones than Memory State Based method, and reduced false negatives.","","978-1-5386-5364-7","10.1109/ICWR.2018.8387232","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8387232","Software engineering;software evolution;code clones;semantic clones","Cloning;Software;Semantics;Software engineering;Syntactics;Current measurement","program diagnostics;program slicing;software maintenance;software quality","semantic code clone detection;abstract memory states;program dependency graphs;software engineering;software evolution;duplicated code snippets;behavioral method;AMS based method;abstract memory state based method;program dependency graph;false negative reduction;PDG","","2","","31","","18 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, the code stylometry model based on the random forest classifier is used to identify a list of possible authors. If the code submitter is not in this list, we analyze the similarity between the submitted code and the program submitted by the author in the list to determine whether there is code cloning. In this way, we can effectively reduce the complexity of program similarity comparison. We propose a PBCS method based on parallel Bidirectional Long Short-Term(Bi-Lstm) Memory network for code similarity detection.

Simple compilation often does not solve the problem due to missing required dependencies, as, e.g., in case of BigCloneBench. In this work, we therefore present the tool STUBBER for compiling Java source code into Bytecode without dependencies. We can show that using Stubber, Bytecode for over 95% of all Java source files and 92.5% of all code clones contained in BigCloneBench can be successfully generated.

There is an important relationship between clones and code quality. Most programmers use clones because they are cheaper and faster than typing the program code. A cloning code is created by copying and pasting the existing code fragments of the source code with or without slight modifications. A major part (5% to 10%) of the source code for large computer programs consists of copy codes. Since cloning is believed to reduce the possibility of software maintenance, many techniques and cloning detection tools have been recommended for this purpose. The basic goal of clone detection is to identify the clone code and replace it with a single call to the function, where the function simulates the behavior of one instance of the clone group. This research provides an overview of the refactoring IDE. The aspects of cloning and detection of cloning are explained.

We present a study of online code clones on Stack Overflow and their toxicity by incorporating two developer surveys and a large-scale code clone detection. A survey of 201 high-reputation Stack Overflow answerers (33 percent response rate) showed that 131 participants (65 percent) have ever been notified of outdated code and 26 of them (20 percent) rarely or never fix the code. 138 answerers (69 percent) never check for licensing conflicts between their copied code snippets and Stack Overflow's CC BY-SA 3.0. A survey of 87 Stack Overflow visitors shows that they experienced several issues from Stack Overflow answers: mismatched solutions, outdated solutions, incorrect solutions, and buggy code. 85 percent of them are not aware of CC BY-SA 3.0 license enforced by Stack Overflow, and 66 percent never check for license conflicts when reusing code snippets. Our clone detection found online clone pairs between 72,365 Java code snippets on Stack Overflow and 111 open source projects in the curated Qualitas corpus.

One key problem is how to represent code fragments well for follow-up analysis. Traditional information retrieval based methods often treat programs as natural language texts, which could miss important semantic information of source code. Recently, state-of-the-art studies demonstrate that abstract syntax tree (AST) based neural models can better represent source code. However, the sizes of ASTs are usually large and the existing models are prone to the long-term dependency problem. In this paper, we propose a novel AST-based Neural Network (ASTNN) for source code representation. Unlike existing models that work on entire ASTs, ASTNN splits each large AST into a sequence of small statement trees, and encodes the statement trees to vectors by capturing the lexical and syntactical knowledge of statements. Based on the sequence of statement vectors, a bidirectional RNN model is used to leverage the naturalness of statements and finally produce the vector representation of a code fragment. We have applied our neural network based source code representation method to two common program comprehension tasks: source code classification and code clone detection. Experimental results on the two tasks indicate that our model is superior to state-of-the-art approaches.","1558-1225","978-1-7281-0869-8","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812062","Abstract Syntax Tree, source code representation, neural network, code classification, code clone detection","Syntactics;Cloning;Semantics;Neural networks;Task analysis;Binary trees;Natural languages","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;program diagnostics;recurrent neural nets;text analysis;tree data structures","abstract syntax tree;code fragment;natural language texts;ASTNN;statement trees;statement vectors;bidirectional RNN model;vector representation;source code representation method;source code classification;code clone detection;program analysis;program comprehension tasks;AST-based Neural Network;neural source code representation;information retrieval;machine learning","","111","","66","","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though some techniques generate representations from unlabeled code, they are far from being satisfactory when applied to the downstream tasks. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposes InferCode, which adapts the self-supervised learning idea from natural language processing to the abstract syntax trees (ASTs) of code. The novelty lies in the training of code representations by predicting subtrees automatically identified from the contexts of ASTs. With InferCode, subtrees in ASTs are treated as the labels for training the code representations without any human labelling effort or the overhead of expensive graph construction, and the trained representations are no longer tied to any specific downstream tasks or code units. We have trained an instance of InferCode model using Tree-Based Convolutional Neural Network (TBCNN) as the encoder of a large set of Java code. This pre-trained model can then be applied to downstream unsupervised tasks such as code clustering, code clone detection, cross-language code search, or be reused under a transfer learning scheme to continue training the model weights for supervised tasks such as code classification and method name prediction. Compared to prior techniques applied to the same downstream tasks, such as code2vec, code2seq, ASTNN, using our pre-trained InferCode model higher performance is achieved with a significant margin for most of the tasks, including those involving different programming languages.

As programming languages are continuing to evolve and morph, code clones also widely exist across different languages for platform compatibility and adoption. Although code clones can improve development efficiency, they are prone to introducing bugs. Existing code clone detection technologies, however, mainly focused on single programming language or syntactical features of code. The syntax of different programming language are diverse because of syntax sugar, and many cloning pairs are semantic related instead of syntactic similar, such as Type 4 clones. To bridge the gap between syntax and semantic, and detect clone-related bugs more accurately, we explore an IR (Intermediate Representation) based method to represent code semantic representation information of multiple language code. We utilize graph neural network to learn code semantic representation. Through the semantic representation, we can detect more cross-language clone related bugs across multiple language.","","978-1-6654-1296-4","10.1109/AINIT54228.2021.00101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9725021","component;code clone detection;bug detection;machine learning;cross language","Seminars;Computer languages;Codes;Semantics;Computer bugs;Cloning;Syntactics","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;program compilers;program debugging;program diagnostics;software maintenance;software tools","clone-related bugs;code semantic representation information;multiple language code;semantic based cross-language clone related bug detection;code clones;programming effort;programming languages;code clone detection technologies;single programming language;different programming language;cloning pairs;Type 4 clones","","","","20","IEEE","8 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to modifications applied after copying and pasting of the cloned code, the current code clone detection tools face challenges to accurately detect clones with heavy modifications (i.e., Type-3 clones or clones with added/deleted/modified statements). One challenge is because the clone results contain several false positives. In this paper, we propose an approach for increasing the precision of code clone detection using machine learning techniques. By training a decision tree on 19 clone class metrics, we use the trained decision tree as a clone filter by placing it in the last step in the clone detection pipeline. This aims to remove false positive clone classes reported by a clone detection tool. We found that the decision tree clone filter is helpful for decreasing the number of false positive clone classes in iClones, a well-known code clone detector. After training the decision tree on 537 clone classes in JFreeChart and evaluating it on the test data set, it could improve iClone's precision from 0.94 to 0.98. The findings show that decision tree can be used effectively for filtering false positive clones. Nonetheless, we found that the filter is only effective for Java and does not offer satisfying performance when running on a Django Python project.","2573-2021","978-1-7281-5590-6","10.1109/IWESEP49350.2019.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945086","code clones;machine learning;decision tree","Cloning;Decision trees;Measurement;Training;Machine learning;Detectors;Data models","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);software metrics;software tools","trained decision tree;clone detection pipeline;clone detection tool;decision tree clone filter;machine learning techniques;code clone detection tools;clone class metrics;iClones;JFreeChart;software project","","","","22","","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many approaches have been proposed to detect code clones, in which token-based methods are the most scalable but cannot handle semantic clones because of the lack of consideration of program semantics. To address the issue, researchers conduct program analysis to distill the program semantics into a graph representation and detect clones by matching the graphs. However, such approaches suffer from low scalability since graph matching is typically time-consuming. In this paper, we propose SCDetector to combine the scalability of token-based methods with the accuracy of graph-based methods for software functional clone detection. Given a function source code, we first extract the control flow graph by static analysis. Instead of using traditional heavyweight graph matching, we treat the graph as a social network and apply social-network-centrality analysis to dig out the centrality of each basic block. Then we assign the centrality to each token in a basic block and sum the centrality ofthe same token in different basic blocks. By this, a graph is turned into certain tokens with graph details (i.e., centrality), called semantic tokens. Finally, these semantic tokens are fed into a Siamese architecture neural network to train a code clone detector. We evaluate SCDetector on two large datasets of functionally similar code. Experimental results indicate that our system is superior to four state-of-the-art methods (i.e., SourcererCC, Deckard, RtvNN, and ASTNN) and the time cost of SCDetector is 14 times less than a traditional graph-based method (i.e., CCSharp) on detecting semantic clones.","2643-1572","978-1-4503-6768-4","","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672249); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9285662","• Software and its engineering → Software maintenance tools;Social Network Centrality;Semantic Tokens;Siamese Network","Scalability;Semantics;Cloning;Detectors;Transforms;Static analysis;Software engineering","graph theory;program diagnostics;software engineering;software maintenance;trees (mathematics)","SCDetector;software functional clone detection;code clone detection;code fragments;similar functionalities;software engineering;code clones;token-based methods;semantic clones;program semantics;program analysis;graph representation;graph-based methods;function source code;control flow graph;static analysis;traditional heavyweight graph matching;social-network-centrality analysis;basic block;graph details;called semantic tokens;code clone detector;functionally similar code;traditional graph-based method","","1","","58","","24 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current code clone detection techniques for finding semantic clones utilize Program Dependency Graphs (PDG), which are expensive and resource-intensive. PDG and other clone detection techniques utilize code and have completely ignored the comments - due to ambiguity of English language, but in terms of program comprehension, comments carry the important domain knowledge. We empirically evaluated the accuracy of detecting clones with both code and comments on a JHotDraw package. Results show that detecting code clones in the presence of comments, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), gave 84% precision and 94% recall, while in the presence of a PDG, using GRAPLE, we got 55% precision and 29% recall. These results indicate that comments can be used to find semantic clones. We recommend utilizing comments with LDA to find clones at the file level and code with PDG for finding clones at the function level. These findings necessitate a need to reexamine the assumptions regarding semantic clone detection techniques.","1943-6106","978-1-5386-4235-1","10.1109/VLHCC.2018.8506550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8506550","","Cloning;Semantics;Software maintenance;Software systems;Reverse engineering;Visualization","graph theory;software reusability;source code (software)","semantic clone detection techniques;code base;Program Dependency Graphs;PDG;source code;code reuse;code clone detection techniques;JHotDraw package;Latent Dirichlet Allocation;LDA","","2","","19","","25 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Malware analysts also apply this technique to detect whether a set of malware applications originated from the same malware family based on the similarity in their source code. Until now, existing notation-based approaches are based on standard identifier notations and generating signatures from the notations output. Specifically, for a set of words (or lexemes), the analysts apply rules to determine the type of a lexeme and label each lexeme with a token type. So far, none of the existing code clone detection models considers collecting identifiers from an external source. In this paper, we propose a novel External-based Identifier Model for code clone detection. The proposed model assumes the existence of an external source code that can be used as a supervisor for identifying and labeling a specific set of lexemes. By introducing the external-identifiers into source code detection, our model could distinguish between multiple fragments of code that share the same sequence of standard tokens. One of the study cases for our model is Android analysis where the Android Open Source Project can be used as an external source. The experiment on one millions line of Android source code has shown that our proposed solution could reduce the number of multiple code mapping to single signature situations in comparison with the traditional method. Furthermore, the experiment on code suggestion has proved that our model could reduce the suggestion step for providing faster output than a notation-based approach.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3016943","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (Development of 5G Edge Security Technology for Ensuring 5G+ Service Stability and Availability)(grant numbers:2020-0-00952); Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), Korea Government through the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC); Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2020-2020-0-01602); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9169649","Program analysis;code clone detection","Syntactics;Cloning;Androids;Humanoid robots;Standards;Security;Tools","invasive software;mobile computing;program diagnostics;software maintenance;software reliability;source code (software)","notation-based code cloning method;code paradigm problem;malware analysts;malware applications;malware family;standard identifier notations;notations output;lexeme;external source code;source code detection;Android Open Source Project;Android source code;multiple code mapping;code suggestion;notation-based approach;external-based identifier model;software development","","","","35","CCBY","17 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As an initial try to detect semantic clones, in this paper, we propose a test-based approach to detecting methods that are semantically equivalent to API methods. For a given method m, we generate its test cases automatically and search for semantically equivalent API methods by running the generated test cases. If two methods generate the same output on each of the test cases, they are taken as semantically equivalent methods. One of the weakness of test-based clone detection is that it is often time consuming. To reduce the time complexity, we take the following measures. First, we focus on methods instead of arbitrary fragments. Second, for a given method, we only compare it against such API methods whose signatures are highly similar to that of the given method. We evaluate the proposed approach on 10 well-known applications.

For such a reason, it is important to understand how code clones are distributed in source code. A variety of code clone detection tools has been developed before now. Recently, some researchers have detected code clones from a large set of source code to find library candidates or overlooked bugs. In general, the smaller the granularity of the detection target is, the longer the detection time. On the other hand, the larger the granularity of the detection target is, the fewer detectable code clones are. In this paper, we propose a technique that detects in order from coarse code clones to fine-grained ones.

Detection of code clones can help to reduce the cost of software maintenance and prevent bugs. Numerous approaches of detecting code clones have been proposed previously, but most of them focus on detecting syntactic clones and do not work well on semantic clones with different syntactic features. To detect semantic clones, researchers have tried to adopt deep learning for code clone detection to automatically learn latent semantic features from data. Especially, to leverage grammar information, several approaches used abstract syntax trees (AST) as input and achieved significant progress on code clone benchmarks in various programming languages. However, these AST-based approaches still can not fully leverage the structural information of code fragments, especially semantic information such as control flow and data flow. To leverage control and data flow information, in this paper, we build a graph representation of programs called flow-augmented abstract syntax tree (FA-AST). We construct FA-AST by augmenting original ASTs with explicit control and data flow edges. Then we apply two different types of graph neural networks (GNN) on FA-AST to measure the similarity of code pairs. As far as we have concerned, we are the first to apply graph neural networks on the domain of code clone detection. We apply our FA-AST and graph neural networks on two Java datasets: Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both Google Code Jam and BigCloneBench tasks.","1534-5351","978-1-7281-5143-4","10.1109/SANER48275.2020.9054857","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9054857","clone detection;data flow;control flow;deep learning;graph neural network","Software maintenance;Java;Codes;Semantics;Cloning;Syntactics;Feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;program debugging;program diagnostics;software maintenance;trees (mathematics)","code clone detection;data flow information;FA-AST;graph neural network;syntactic clones;flow-augmented abstract syntax tree;software maintenance;bug prevention;graph representation;code fragment pair similarity;deep learning","","30","","24","IEEE","2 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their knowledge is transferred to downstream tasks (e.g. code clone detection) via fine-tuning. In natural language processing (NLP), other alternatives for transferring the knowledge of PTLMs are explored through using adapters, compact, parameter efficient modules inserted in the layers of the PTLM. Although adapters are known to facilitate adapting to many downstream tasks compared to fine-tuning the model that require retraining all of the models' parameters- which owes to the adapters' plug and play nature and being parameter efficient-their usage in software engineering is not explored. Here, we explore the knowledge transfer using adapters and based on the Naturalness Hypothesis proposed by Hindle et. al [12]. Thus, studying the bimodality of adapters for two tasks of cloze test and code clone detection, compared to their benchmarks from the CodeXGLUE platform. These adapters are trained using programming languages and are inserted in a PTLM that is pre-trained on English corpora (N-PTLM). Three programming languages, $\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{C}++$, Python, and Java, are studied along with extensive experiments on the best setup used for adapters. Improving the results of the N-PTLM confirms the success of the adapters in knowledge transfer to software engineering, which sometimes are in par with or exceed the results of a PTLM trained on source code; while being more efficient in terms of the number of parameters, memory usage, and inference time. Our results can open new directions to build smaller models for more software engineering tasks.

It hinders the ability of academic instructors to truly judge students’ performance and thus, prevents students from receiving adequate help from their instructors. In cases where the number of code submissions for a particular assignment is relatively small, the instructor can inspect each code submission to determine whether they are similar. But as the number of code submissions grows, it becomes difficult to detect similarities between them. Therefore, this induces the need for an automatic source code plagiarism detector. Previous studies showed that we could use the abstract syntax tree (AST) of a source code to get an accurate representation of the source code for neural network computations. Although a study even presented a recursive artificial neural network named Abstract Syntax Tree-based Neural Network (ASTNN) that could represent source codes into vector embeddings using their ASTs, it does not use contrastive learning paradigms, shown to increase the performance of Siamese networks in similarity detection tasks. Therefore, this paper presents an improved version of the ASTNN for code clone detection, where we modify the original model for contrastive learning. Experiments demonstrated that we outperform the original ASTNN model in code clone detection tasks, with a+5% improvement in the F1-score of our model.

The presence of clone is known as bad smell, which is phenomena of source code to be refactored. A motivation of refactoring (merging) clones is to reduce the size of source code. An existing study proposed a technique to estimate reduced lines of code by merging clones; however, there are two issues in the existing technique: (1) the existing technique does not consider the refactorability of clones in spite that it is difficult or even impossible to merge some clones due to the limitation of programming languages; (2) in the case that multiple clones are overlapping, the existing technique only considers one of them can be merged. Due to the above issues, estimated reducible LoC is occasionally different from the actual number. Consequently, in this research, we propose a new technique to calculate a reducible LoC. The proposed technique is free from the two issues, and it calculates a reducible LoC fully automatically. The proposed technique performs a loop processing of (a) detecting clones, (b) merging them, (c) compiling the edited source files, and (d) testing them. After finishing the loop, reducible LoC is calculated from the edited source files. This paper also includes comparison results of the proposed technique and the existing one. In the comparisons, we confirmed that a reducible LoC which was calculated with considering refactorability is 25% of a reducible LoC which was estimated without considering refactorability. We also confirmed that the proposed technique was able to merge clones that were not counted in the existing technique.","2640-0715","978-1-7281-4648-5","10.1109/APSEC48747.2019.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945738","Software maintenance;code clone;refactoring","Cloning;Merging;Computer languages;Maintenance engineering;Tools;Testing;Software systems","program compilers;software maintenance;source code (software)","LoC;clone refactoring;code clone;code fragment;source code;clone detection;refactorability;software maintenance","","2","","17","","2 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is to provide rich information on identical and similar code across projects. Detecting near-miss code clones on big code is challenging since it requires intensive computing and memory resources as the scale of the source code increases. In this work, we propose SAGA, an efficient suffix-array based code clone detection tool designed with sophisticated GPU optimization. SAGA not only detects Type-l and Type-2 clones but also does so for cross-project large repositories and for the most computationally expensive Type-3 clones. Meanwhile, it also works at segment granularity, which is even more challenging. It detects code clones in 100 million lines of code within 11 minutes (with recall and precision comparable to state-of-the-art approaches), which is more than 10 times faster than state-of-the-art tools. It is the only tool that efficiently detects Type-3 near-miss clones at segment granularity in large code repository (e.g., within 11 hours on 1 billion lines of code). We conduct a preliminary case study on 85,202 GitHub Java projects with 1 billion lines of code and exhibit the distribution of clones across projects. We find about 1.23 million Type-3 clone groups, containing 28 million lines of code at arbitrary segment granularity, which are only detectable with SAGA.

Interface similarity is a kind of replication that refers to the similarity of method names, return types and parameter types which repeat across the code repositories. Two methods with similar interfaces are prone to be cloned if those perform analogous functions either entirely or at least partially. An exploratory study is performed in this paper, to explore the relationship and effects of interface similarity in code clones. It is investigated that interface similarity can be helpful for code clone detection. First, clone methods are detected in code repositories. Then, interface information is extracted from source code and several interface similarities are measured using that information. The experimental corpus contains three different types of code repositories with 35, 109 and 24,558 Java projects respectively. The detected clone pairs in three code repositories are, on average 57,457, 102,745 and 123,576 respectively. Promising results are found as it shows on average 87.91% intra-project and 59.17% inter-project clones contain similar interfaces (i.e., return types and at least one keyword and one parameter type are similar). Besides, the average similarity of interfaces in Type-1, Type-2 and Type-3 clones are 100%, 83.47% and 81.90% respectively. These results prove the strong relationship between code clones and interface similarities.

Despite the importance of logs, prior studies show that there is no industrial standard on how to write logging statements. In this paper, we focus on studying duplicate logging statements, which are logging statements that have the same static text message. Such duplications in the text message are potential indications of logging code smells, which may affect developers’ understanding of the dynamic view of the system. We manually studied over 4K duplicate logging statements and their surrounding code in five large-scale open source systems: Hadoop, CloudStack, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and Flink. We uncovered five patterns of duplicate logging code smells. For each instance of the duplicate logging code smell, we further manually identify the potentially problematic (i.e., require fixes) and justifiable (i.e., do not require fixes) cases. Then, we contact developers to verify our manual study result. We integrated our manual study result and developers’ feedback into our automated static analysis tool, DLFinder, which automatically detects problematic duplicate logging code smells. We evaluated DLFinder on the five manually studied systems and three additional systems: Camel, Kafka and Wicket. In total, combining the results of DLFinder and our manual analysis, we reported 91 problematic duplicate logging code smell instances to developers and all of them have been fixed. We further study the relationship between duplicate logging statements, including the problematic instances of duplicate logging code smells, and code clones. We find that 83 percent of the duplicate logging code smell instances reside in cloned code, but 17 percent of them reside in micro-clones that are difficult to detect using automated clone detection tools. We also find that more than half of the duplicate logging statements reside in cloned code snippets, and a large portion of them reside in very short code blocks which may not be effectively detected by existing code clone detection tools. Our study shows that, in addition to general source code that implements the business logic, code clones may also result in bad logging practices that could increase maintenance difficulties.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2021.3060918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9360483","Log;code smell;duplicate log;code clone;static analysis;empirical study","Cloning;Manuals;Tools;Static analysis;Maintenance engineering;Java;Cloud computing","program debugging;program diagnostics;public domain software;software maintenance","duplicate logging statements;code clone detection tools;bad logging practices;software logs;problematic duplicate logging code smell instances;Hadoop;CloudStack;Elasticsearch;Cassandra;Flink;automated static analysis tool;DLFinder;business logic","","2","","82","IEEE","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although these models achieve the state of the arts results in many downstream tasks such as code summarization and bug detection, they are based on Transformer and PLM, which are mainly studied in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. The current studies rely on the reasoning and practices from NLP for these models in code, despite the differences between natural languages and programming languages. There is also limited literature on explaining how code is modeled. Here, we investigate the attention behavior of PLM on code and compare it with natural language. We pre-trained BERT, a Transformer based PLM, on code and explored what kind of information it learns, both semantic and syntactic. We run several experiments to analyze the attention values of code constructs on each other and what BERT learns in each layer. Our analyses show that BERT pays more attention to syntactic entities, specifically identifiers and separators, in contrast to the most attended token [CLS] in NLP. This observation motivated us to leverage identifiers to represent the code sequence instead of the [CLS] token when used for code clone detection. Our results show that employing embeddings from identifiers increases the performance of BERT by 605% and 4% F1-score in its lower layers and the upper layers, respectively. When identifiers' embeddings are used in CodeBERT, a code-based PLM, the performance is improved by 21-24% in the F1-score of clone detection. The findings can benefit the research community by using code-specific representations instead of applying the common embeddings used in NLP, and open new directions for developing smaller models with similar performance.","2643-7171","978-1-4503-9298-3","10.1145/3524610.3527921","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RGPIN-2019-05175); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796241","pre-trained language models;BERT;CodeBERT;attention","Codes;Particle separators;Bit error rate;Semantics;Cloning;Syntactics;Transformers","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;program debugging;software engineering;source code (software);text analysis","code attention;software engineering;deep neural model;transformer architecture;code summarization;bug detection;NLP;programming languages;attention behavior;code constructs;code sequence;code clone detection;code-based PLM;code-specific representation;bug detection;transformer-based pretrained language model;code modeling;CodeBERT;semantic information;syntactic information","","","","50","","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve the problem of PDG-based tool's high time cost, we adopt two strategies to decrease the overall computing quantity of our tool: PDG's structure modification and characteristic vector filtering. In PDG's structure modification, we propose a novel technique to merge procedure invocation nodes which can make clone detection get rid of influence of procedure's parameters and disguise as well as downscale PDG's structure. We proceed clone detection on both real-world and artificial codebase by CCSharp along with other three state-of-the-art tools.

The identification of libraries written in C or C++ is impeded by compilation process which hides most features of code. The same open-source package can be compiled into different binary code by different compilation processes. Therefore, this paper proposes LibDX, a platform-independent and fully-automated system, to detect reused libraries in binary files. With a well-designed feature extractor, LibDX can overcome compilation diversity between binary files. LibDX novelly introduces the logic feature block concept which is applied to deal with the feature duplication challenge in a large-scale feature database. We built a large test data set covering multiple platforms and evaluated LibDX with 9.5K packages including 25.8K C/C++ binary files.

In this paper we fill this gap by comparing four different clone detection tools (NiCad, CPD, iClones, TCORE) against the test code of three open-source projects.

However, identifying cross-language clones presents special challenges to the clone detection problem. A lack of common underlying representation between arbitrary languages means detecting clones requires one of the following solutions: 1) a static analysis framework replicated across each targeted language with annotations matching language features across all languages, or 2) a dynamic analysis framework that detects clones based on runtime behavior. In this work, we demonstrate the feasibility of the latter solution, a dynamic analysis approach called SLACC for cross-language clone detection. Like prior clone detection techniques, we use input/output behavior to match clones, though we overcome limitations of prior work by amplifying the number of inputs and covering more data types; and as a result, achieve better clusters than prior attempts. Since clusters are generated based on input/output behavior, SLACC supports cross-language clone detection. As an added challenge, we target a static typed language, Java, and a dynamic typed language, Python. Compared to HitoshiIO, a recent clone detection tool for Java, SLACC retrieves 6 times as many clusters and has higher precision (86.7% vs. 30.7%). This is the first work to perform clone detection for dynamic typed languages (precision = 87.3%) and the first to perform clone detection across languages that lack a common underlying representation (precision = 94.1%).

Specifically, we focus on this question: do neural clone detectors truly learn the ability to detect semantic clones, or they just learn how to model specific functionalities in training data while cannot generalize to realistic unseen functionalitiesƒ This paper investigates how the generalizability can be evaluated and improved.Our contributions are 3-folds: (1) We propose an evaluation methodology that can systematically measure the cross-functionality generalizability of neural clone detection. Based on this evaluation methodology, an empirical study is conducted and the results indicate that current neural clone detectors cannot generalize well as expected. (2) We conduct empirical analysis to understand key factors that can impact the generalizability. We investigate 3 factors: training data diversity, vocabulary, and locality. Results show that the performance loss on unseen functionalities can be reduced through addressing the out-of-vocabulary problem and increasing training data diversity. (3) We propose a human-in-the-loop mechanism that help adapt neural clone detectors to new code repositories containing lots of unseen functionalities.

Framework uses IdaPro [1] disassembler and Binnavi [2] platform to recover structure of the target program and represent it as a call graph (CG). A program dependence graph (PDG) corresponds to each vertex of the CG. The proposed comparison algorithm consists of two main stages. At the first stage, several heuristics are applied to find the exact matches. Two functions are matched if at least one of the calculated heuristics is the same and unique in both binaries. At the second stage, backward and forward slicing is applied on matched vertices of CG to find further matches. According to empiric results heuristic method is effective and has high matching quality for unchanged or slightly modified functions. As a contradiction, to match heavily modified functions, binary code clone detection is used and it is based on finding maximum common subgraph for pair of PDGs. To achieve high performance on extensive binaries, the whole matching process is parallelized. The framework is tested on the number of real world libraries, such as python, openssh, openssl, libxml2, rsync, php, etc. Results show that in most cases more than 95% functions are truly matched. The tool is scalable due to parallelization of functions matching process and generation of PDGs and CGs.","","978-1-5386-1132-6","10.1109/ISPRAS.2017.00013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8273295","Binary code comparison;static analysis;program dependence graph","Tools;Computer bugs;Semantics;Cloning;Binary codes;Algorithm design and analysis;Libraries","binary codes;graph theory;invasive software;program debugging;program diagnostics;program slicing","Binnavi platform;call graph;program dependence graph;PDG;forward slicing;backward slicing;maximum common subgraph;real world libraries;functions matching process parallelization;IdaPro disassembler;well-known bugs prevention;matching process;extensive binaries;binary code clone detection;heavily modified functions;slightly modified functions;unchanged modified functions;high matching quality;empiric results heuristic method;matched vertices;calculated heuristics;exact matches;main stages;comparison algorithm;CG;target program;statically linked libraries;old versions;programmatic changes;practical applications;binary files;accurate binary code comparison;scalable framework","","5","","22","","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main challenge of cross-language program classification is how to extract semantic features of different programming languages. In order to cope with this difficulty, we propose a Unified Abstract Syntax Tree (namely UAST in this paper) neural network. In detail, the core idea of UAST consists of two unified mechanisms. First, UAST learns an AST representation by unifying the AST traversal sequence and graph-like AST structure for capturing semantic code features. Second, we construct a mechanism called unified vocabulary, which can reduce the feature gap between different programming languages, so it can achieve the role of cross-language program classification. Besides, we collect a dataset containing 20,000 files of five programming languages, which can be used as a benchmark dataset for the cross-language program classification task. We have done experiments on two datasets, and the results show that our proposed approach out-performs the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of four evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy).","2643-7171","978-1-4503-9298-3","10.1145/3524610.3527915","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072227); Research Council of Norway(grant numbers:309494); Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(grant numbers:cstc2021jcyj-msxmX0538); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796351","Program Comprehension;Program Classification;Code Representation Learning;Cross-language Program Classification","Representation learning;Computer languages;Vocabulary;Codes;Semantics;Neural networks;Syntactics","data analysis;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;neural nets;object-oriented programming;pattern classification;program compilers;program diagnostics;software engineering;software libraries;software maintenance;software metrics;tree data structures;trees (mathematics)","Unified abstract Syntax Tree representation learning;source code comprehension;code clone detection;code smell classification;code transfer;cross-language code reuse;cross-language tasks;semantic code features;cross-language program classification task","","","","47","","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most recent approaches for representing source code still use AST and do not leverage semantic graphs such as CFG and PDG. One effective technique for representing source code involves extracting paths from the AST and using a learning model to capture program properties. Code2vec is one such path-based approach that uses an attention-based neural network to learn code embeddings which can then be used for various downstream tasks. However, this approach uses only AST and does not leverage CFG and PDG. Even though an integrated graph approach (Code Property Graph) exists for representing source code, it has only been explored in the domain of software security. Moreover, it does not leverage the paths from the individual graphs. Our idea is to extend the path-based approach code2vec to include the semantic graphs CFG and PDG with AST, which is largely unexplored in software engineering. We evaluate our approach on the task of METHODNAMING using a C dataset of 730K methods collected from GitHub. In comparison to code2vec, our approach improves the F1 score by 11% on the full dataset and up to 100% with individual projects.

To effectively learn the AST hierarchy, we use contrastive learning to allow the network to predict the AST node level and learn the hierarchical relationships between nodes in a self-supervised manner, which makes the representation vectors of nodes with greater differences in AST levels farther apart in the embedding space. By using such vectors, the structural similarities between code snippets can be measured more precisely. In the learning process, a novel GNN (called Residual Self-attention Graph Neural Network, RSGNN) is designed, which enables HELoC to focus on embedding the local structure of an AST while capturing its overall structure. HELoC is self-supervised and can be applied to many source code related downstream tasks such as code classification, code clone detection, and code clustering after pre-training.

However, most existing methods generate neural program embeddings di-rectly from the program source codes, by learning from features such as tokens, abstract syntax trees, and control flow graphs. This paper takes a fresh look at how to improve program embed-dings by leveraging compiler intermediate representation (IR). We first demonstrate simple yet highly effective methods for enhancing embedding quality by training embedding models alongside source code and LLVM IR generated by default optimization levels (e.g., -02). We then introduce IRGEN, a framework based on genetic algorithms (GA), to identify (near-)optimal sequences of optimization flags that can significantly improve embedding quality. We use IRGEN to find optimal sequences of LLVM optimization flags by performing GA on source code datasets. We then extend a popular code embedding model, CodeCMR, by adding a new objective based on triplet loss to enable a joint learning over source code and LLVM IR. We benchmark the quality of embedding using a rep-resentative downstream application, code clone detection. When CodeCMR was trained with source code and LLVM IRs optimized by findings of IRGEN, the embedding quality was significantly im-proved, outperforming the state-of-the-art model, CodeBERT, which was trained only with source code. Our augmented CodeCMR also outperformed CodeCMR trained over source code and IR optimized with default optimization levels. We investigate the properties of optimization flags that increase embedding quality, demonstrate IRGEN's generalization in boosting other embedding models, and establish IRGEN's use in settings with extremely limited training data. Our research and findings demonstrate that a straightforward addition to modern neural code embedding models can provide a highly effective enhancement.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-9221-1","10.1145/3510003.3510217","CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793906","program embedding;deep learing;compiler technique","Training;Codes;Program processors;Cloning;Training data;Syntactics;Task analysis","embedded systems;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;program compilers;program diagnostics;program verification","compiler intermediate representation;neural program embeddings;program analysis tasks;program repair;code completion;program synthesis;program source codes;program embed-dings;embedding quality;training embedding models;LLVM IR;default optimization levels;IRGEN;optimal sequences;LLVM optimization flags;source code datasets;popular code embedding model;code clone detection;modern neural code embedding models","","","","106","","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since code clones often negatively impact the maintainability of a software system, a great many numbers of code clone detection techniques and tools have been proposed and studied over the last decade. To detect all possible similar source code patterns in general, the clone detection tools work on syntax level (such as texts, tokens, AST and so on) while lacking user-specific preferences. This often means the reported clones must be manually validated prior to any analysis in order to filter out the true positive clones from task or user-specific considerations. This manual clone validation effort is very time-consuming and often error-prone, in particular for large-scale clone detection. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based approach for automating the validation process. In an experiment with clones detected by several clone detectors in several different software systems, we found our approach has an accuracy of up to 87.4% when compared against the manual validation by multiple expert judges.

Recently, motivated by the success of deep learning models in other fields, including natural language processing and computer vision, researchers have attempted to adopt deep learning techniques to detect code clones. These approaches use lexical information (tokens) and(or) syntactic structures like abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to detect code clones. However, they do not make sufficient use of the available structural and semantic information, hence limiting their capabilities. This paper addresses the problem of semantic code clone detection using program dependency graphs and geometric neural networks, leveraging the structured syntactic and semantic information.

However, recognizing logically similar assembly functions remains a challenge. De facto binary code search tools rely on program structure-level information, including control flow and data flow graphs, extracted via standard program analysis techniques or deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNN-based approaches capture lexical-, control structure-, or data flow-level information of binary code for representation learning, which can be too coarse-grained and does not faithfully denote program functionality. It can also suffer from low robustness to various challenging settings like compiler optimizations and obfuscations. This paper proposes a general solution to enhance the top-k ranked candidates of DNN-based binary code function search. The key idea is to design a low-cost and comprehensive equivalence check, which quickly exposes functionality deviations between the target function and its top-k matched functions. Functions failed this equivalence check can be shaved from the top-k list, whereas functions passing the check can be reconsidered to move ahead on the top-k ranked candidates, in a deliberate way. We design a practical and efficient equivalence check, named BinUSE, using under-constrained symbolic execution (USE). USE, a variant of symbolic execution, improves scalability by launching symbolic execution directly from function entry points and relaxing constraints over function parameters. It alleviates overhead incurred by path explosion and costly constraints. BinUSE is particularly designed to deliver a soundy function-level equivalence check, enhancing DNN-based binary code search by reducing its false alarms with low cost. Our evaluation shows that BinUSE can enable a general and effective enhancement of three DNN-based binary code search tools against challenges introduced by different compilers, optimizations, obfuscations, and architectures.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2022.3149240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9707874","Reverse Engineering;Symbolic Execution;Software Similarity;Deep Learning","Binary codes;Standards;Optimization;Task analysis;Malware;Security;Semantics","","","","","","","IEEE","8 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"VUDDY: A Scalable Approach for Vulnerable Code Clone Discovery","S. Kim; S. Woo; H. Lee; H.

In addition, code clones - code fragments that are copied and pasted within or between software systems - are also proliferating. Although code cloning may expedite the process of software development, it often critically affects the security of software because vulnerabilities and bugs can easily be propagated through code clones. These vulnerable code clones are increasing in conjunction with the growth of OSS, potentially contaminating many systems. Although researchers have attempted to detect code clones for decades, most of these attempts fail to scale to the size of the ever-growing OSS code base. The lack of scalability prevents software developers from readily managing code clones and associated vulnerabilities. Moreover, most existing clone detection techniques focus overly on merely detecting clones and this impairs their ability to accurately find ""vulnerable"" clones. In this paper, we propose VUDDY, an approach for the scalable detection of vulnerable code clones, which is capable of detecting security vulnerabilities in large software programs efficiently and accurately. Its extreme scalability is achieved by leveraging function-level granularity and a length-filtering technique that reduces the number of signature comparisons. This efficient design enables VUDDY to preprocess a billion lines of code in 14 hour and 17 minutes, after which it requires a few seconds to identify code clones. In addition, we designed a security-aware abstraction technique that renders VUDDY resilient to common modifications in cloned code, while preserving the vulnerable conditions even after the abstraction is applied. This extends the scope of VUDDY to identifying variants of known vulnerabilities, with high accuracy. In this study, we describe its principles and evaluate its efficacy and effectiveness by comparing it with existing mechanisms and presenting the vulnerabilities it detected. VUDDY outperformed four state-of-the-art code clone detection techniques in terms of both scalability and accuracy, and proved its effectiveness by detecting zero-day vulnerabilities in widely used software systems, such as Apache HTTPD and Ubuntu OS Distribution.","2375-1207","978-1-5090-5533-3","10.1109/SP.2017.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7958600","software vulnerability;vulnerability detection;code clone","Cloning;Scalability;Security;Linux;Kernel;Androids","program diagnostics;public domain software;security of data;source code (software)","VUDDY;scalable approach;code clone discovery vulnerability;open source software;OSS;code clones detection;function-level granularity;length-filtering technique;security-aware abstraction technique;zero-day vulnerabilities","","91","","45","","26 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, compared to costly training a large-scale model from scratch, how to effectively adapt pre-trained models to a new task has not been fully explored. In this paper, we propose an approach to bridge pre-trained models and code-related tasks. We exploit semantic-preserving transformation to enrich downstream data diversity, and help pre-trained models learn semantic features invariant to these semantically equivalent transformations. Further, we introduce curriculum learning to or-ganize the transformed data in an easy-to-hard manner to fine-tune existing pre-trained models. We apply our approach to a range of pre-trained models, and they significantly outperform the state-of-the-art models on tasks for source code understanding, such as algorithm classification, code clone detection, and code search. Our experiments even show that without heavy pre-training on code data, natural language pre-trained model RoBERTa fine-tuned with our lightweight approach could outperform or rival existing code pre-trained models fine-tuned on the above tasks, such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT. This finding suggests that there is still much room for improvement in code pre-trained models.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-9221-1","10.1145/3510003.3510062","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61690203,61872373,62032019,U1936213); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9793959","fine-tuning;data augmentation;curriculum learning;test-time aug-mentation","Training;Adaptation models;Codes;Natural languages;Semantics;Cloning;Data models","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;software maintenance","source code understanding;downstream tasks;existing pre-trained models;heavy pre-training;natural language pre-trained model RoBERTa fine-tuned;existing code pre-trained models;bridging pre-trained models","","","","58","","20 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The state-of-the-art pre-trained models such as CodeBERT require the availability of large-scale code corpora. However, gathering training samples can be costly and infeasible for domain-specific languages such as Solidity for smart contracts. In this paper, we propose Zecoler, a zero-shot learning approach for code representations. Zecoler is built upon a pre-trained programming language model. In order to elicit knowledge from the pre-trained models efficiently, Zecoler casts the downstream tasks to the same form of pre-training tasks by inserting trainable prompts into the original input. Then, it employs the prompt learning technique to optimize the pre-trained model by merely adjusting the original input. This enables the representation model to efficiently fit the scarce task-specific data while reusing pre-trained knowledge. We evaluate Zecoler in three code intelligence tasks in two programming languages that have no training samples, namely, Solidity and Go, with model trained in corpora of common languages such as Java. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.","2643-7171","978-1-4503-9298-3","10.1145/3524610.3527888","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62032004,62102244); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9796313","Learning Program Representations;Zero-Shot Learning;Prompt Learning;Code Intelligence","Representation learning;Training;Computer languages;Solid modeling;Codes;Smart contracts;Cloning","high level languages;learning (artificial intelligence)","zero-shot program representation learning;code intelligence tasks;domain-specific languages;Zecoler;code representations;pre-trained programming language model;prompt learning technique;smart contracts","","","","44","","22 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
